battery.sh
==========

`battery` is a simple shell script to fetch the battery status on all the
platforms I've run tmux on a laptop on.

It's ideally suited to being used in a tmux config, like for example..  [mine][1].

This script is released under the terms of the MIT license.. but if you want to
use it for something commercial (like publish it in a book *cough*) I'd really
appreciate it if you dropped me a line first.
